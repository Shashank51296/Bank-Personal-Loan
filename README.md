# Bank-Personal-Loan
This project addresses a classification issue concerning personal loans in the Thera-Bank dataset. Most of Thera-Bank's customers are depositors, with a relatively small number also being borrowers (referred to as asset customers). To expand its loan business and increase profits from loan interest, the bank seeks to grow its asset customer base as quickly as possible. Specifically, the bank management hopes to convert liability customers into retail loans while retaining their deposit business. A previous deposit campaign by the bank resulted in a conversion rate of over 9.6%, which has motivated the retail marketing department to devise targeted marketing campaigns with a limited budget to enhance the success rate. The department wants to create a classifier to identify potential customers more likely to buy the loan, thereby raising the success rate and lowering campaign costs.

The dataset contains both customer information and customer response to the last personal loan campaign:

ID: ID of the customer

Age: Age of the customer in completed years

Experience: Amount of work experience in years

Income: Amount of annual income (in thousands)

Zipcode: Postal code in which the client lives

Family: Number of family members

CCAvg: Average monthly spending with the credit card (in thousands)

Education: Education level (1: bachelor's degree, 2: master's degree, 3: advanced/professional degree)

Mortgage: Value of home mortgage, if any (in thousands)

Securities Account: Does the customer have a securities account with the bank?

CD Account: Does the customer have a certificate of deposit account (CD) with the bank?

Online: Does the customer use the internet banking facilities?

CreditCard: Does the customer use a credit card issued by the bank?

Personal Loan: Did this customer accept the personal loan offered in the last campaign? (Target Variable)

Objective: To use different classification models to predict the likelihood that a customer will buy a personal loan.
